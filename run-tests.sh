# This script will run all the scripts in the tests/* directory which create a
# sample pack, called the 'test-pack'. This newly generated sample pack is then
# compared against the 'stable-pack'. If there are samples in the stable-pack
# which are missing or non-matching in the test-pack then the test is failed.
# Conversely, if there are samples in the test-pack which are not yet present
# in the stable pack then these need to be auditioned/reviewed and added to the
# stable-pack.

# NOTE: This test script has been optimised to avoid using too much disk space,
# now checksums are stored in checksums.yaml and these are used to test the
# test pack rather than using the stable pack. Its not as cool, but its way
# more performant.
