# Naive Instruments

This is an audio library, its my naive attempt to implement an audio library to
calm myself down while I'm in an anxiety state. I'm not really thinking about 
performance, just about what makes sense to me. That's why its naive.

It aims to be a command line application for editing & processing audio signals.
