## Installation
 
At the moment, the makefile is only set up to build for Mac OS.

You will need [boost](https://www.boost.org)!

```bash
brew install boost
```

Compile it:

```bash
make
```

Add the `bin/` directory [to your path](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/).

.bashrc

```bash
PATH=$PATH:~/path/to/this/repo/bin
```
