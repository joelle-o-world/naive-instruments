# Naive Instruments

This is an audio library, its my naive attempt to implement an audio library to
calm myself down while I'm in an anxiety state. I'm not really thinking about 
performance, just about what makes sense to me. That's why its naive.

It aims to be a command line application for editing & processing audio signals.

## Installation
 
At the moment, the makefile is only set up to build for Mac OS.

You will need [boost](https://www.boost.org)!

```bash
brew install boost
```

Compile it:

```bash
make
```

Add the `bin/` directory [to your path](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/).

.bashrc

```bash
PATH=$PATH:~/path/to/this/repo/bin
```

## Control Signal shorthand

PLEASE NOTE: I'm kinda planning to change this a lot soon based on what I've learnt from using it for a while. Watch this space..

You may use a shorthand for control signals. These are made out of a sequence 
of time-steps.

Use `_` to indicate that the signal should remain static for one step.

Use `~` to indicate that the signal should be gliding toward the next value for 
a step.

Use a number to set the value of a step.

Use a colon `:` for tempo indication.

(Maybe,) use `Â±` for lfo vibrato?


### Examples

Start at `440Hz` for 4 steps, then switch (instantly) to 550Hz
```
440Hz____550Hz____
```

Start at `1` and glide to `0` over 4 seconds

```
1s: 1~~~~0
```

Frequency signal for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star

```
120bpm:
c_ c_ g_ g_ a_ a_ g__  
f_ f_ e_ e_ d_ d_ c__
```
